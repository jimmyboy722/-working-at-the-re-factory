# Description
This is a refactoring of an existing webpage to meet the standards of the hypothetical client per requirements of the bootcamp's Module  1 challenge.

# What is code refactoring? 
Well, in my extensive 2 weeks of experience, it seems like code refactoring is a way for developers to clean up their or someone else' code. And that includes the following:

# Semantic Tags
Semantic tags are used to show specifically what part of your code individual elements are.
In this case, I added header, main, aside and footer tags.
This will also help read the code for a webpage a lot more easily.
I also added Alt attributes for all of the images in the HTML document to assist with accessibility for impared individuals, which will also help improve the web page's SEO.

# HTML Document Structure
An HTML document should follow a logical structure so that it can be read and worked on easily.
In this case, I had to add add id attributes and also fixed one of the heading elements so it followed sequential order.
Along with adding seantic tags, they must follow logical sequential order as well. Now we can see the individual sections of the page which also makes styling it with CSS a breeze! Or at least less difficult.

# CSS Organization
When styling an HTML document, you can end up adding a TON of rules in your CSS file to make your webpage or website look and act like a million bucks. Class and id selectors, element attributes, margins, borders, padding and everything including the kitchen sink can easily pile up on top of each other. Then, next thing you know, you cant remember which heading attribute was for what and so on. That being said, I took the following steps to help organize this particular styling sheet a litte:
- Added a space between rules
- consolidated multiple class and id selectors with identical rules into one. Also changed the corresponding class or id in the HTML document as well.
- Added notes as to what was changed and/or what specific rules are for
